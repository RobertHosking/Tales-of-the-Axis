“What am I?”, he asked himself in amusement. 

“Well, I am a captain, but who isn't?”. The lights in the shuttle flashed yellow to indicate atmosphere entry. 

“I have taken lives, but I am not a murderer.”

A neighboring passenger who sat to his right cleared his throat loudly. 

“I don't work for anyone, not a soldier or an assassin.”

Darrus looked out the suttle’s bay window and saw a black mist surrounding the city.

“Perhaps I should be an assassin, there are many overloads willing to hire. It would pay very well.”

The being who sat adjacent to Darrus was a young female Karian with beautiful blue skin. Darrus remembered reading of the first encounter with Karians and humans. As the historical text read, “The Karians gave us technology we gave them philosophy.” 

She wore ceremonial Karian robes which suggested government status and wealth. She was a senator. 

The lights turned blue and the shuttle doors opened and the black fog began to enter the doors and fill the shuttle. Darrus put on his helmet and activated the air filter. The air in the city was deemed breathable but nobody was taking chances. As Darrus exited the shuttle he swiped his hand over a PCI scanner. Every living being had two Personal Chip Insertions (PCIs) on in a forward facing limb, for convenience and one implanted near vital organs for security. A PCI contains personal information, personal credit, medical records, and a list of criminal offenses. 

The ride on the shuttle cost 10,000 credits. A shuttle commute to Stellosia was cheaper than the docking fee he would have to pay for his class C vessel, he would also have to pay for an inspection that he knew he would not pass.

The city was dark with smog, lights blurred and flashed dimly to indicate buildings and vehicles. DArrus looked around him and saw no trace of the other shuttle passengers. He felt alone though he heard voices, rustling, various screeches and bangs as lights whizzed past him. Darrus remembered a trick his uncle had taught him once when the pair was swamp fishing for sucker-fish on Epsilon-9. They were wearing similar helmets as Darrus was wearing now to shield themselves from the thick methane gas that clung to the swamps. When Darrus complained that he could not see the fish, his uncle advised him to activate his night vision to aid his vision in the dense fog.

Darrus placed his left hand on the side of his helmet and felt for the night vision switch. A bright green light on Darrus’ helmet joined the others in the city nd Darrus; vision was improved ten fold. Darrus noticed the dozens of beings who were moving around him, scurrying from vehicle to vehicle, building to building. Darrus remembered why he was here in this Hellish city, he was here to meet with Uzkashed, a Karian officer that Darrus has befriended some years back. Darrus made his way to an automated taxi service station, swiped his hand over a scanner and entered his thirty digit purchase key and the destination he wished to go to. A taxi pod rose up from a hole in the concrete and a door slid open. Darrus ducked down and slid into the pod. The door shut and the taxi began to rumble and list off the ground. Darrus removed his helmet once the air was filtered out of the taxi.

The taxi was cramped and flimsy. The egg shaped vehicle’s body was primarily comprised of a thin transparent material. The rest was a yellow painted metal. After list off the taxi proved to be fast and nimble. Darrus, with his head almost between his knees in the taxi, noticed a holographic screen materialize in front of him. A map of Stallosia began to dissolve into view. By now the pod was speeding above the city. 

“Welcome to Stellosia!”, an artificial female voice greeted him. “You are here.” A red dot on the holographic screen appeared. “If this is your first visit please purchase an air purifying helmet before you leave the cab. Swipe your PCI to buy one for only 1400 credits.” Darrus began to ignore the voice which continued to ramble as the pod sped up to keep with traffic. He wondered where the helmets were kept in the small pod. 

Occasionally the pod rose above the dark smoke and Darrus could see distant needle-like buildings and flashing lights.

“Approaching destination: IOTA Tower. E.T.A. One-hundred and twenty seconds.” By now Darrus was beginning to feel uncomfortable and two minutes feel like an eternity. The bustling streets below offered more amusement that the display screen that persisted in annoying him. Suddenly, he emerged from the smoke again, this time in the epicenter of the smokeless expanse was a massive building jutting into the sky. He could see hundreds of specks orbiting, entering and exiting the building. White fluorescent lettering adorned the structure. The largest group of letters read “IOTA Intersystems” and the pod was rapidly approaching the “O” in “IOTA”. IOTA InterSystems controlled the production and distribution of credits to the entire galaxy. It was IOTA’s job to keep the value of credits equal on every planet and to control inflation on an intergalactic scale. Needless to say, IOTA has been experiencing “economic issues” because last Darrus checked, a shuttle ride doesn't cost 10,000 credits. 

“Brace yourself for deacceleration.”, the artificial voice said sternly as a handle extended out for Darrus to grab. The pod flew through a hole in the building and continued down a brightly lit tunnel. Darrus looked out the left window as hundreds of supporting columns seemed to fly past him. A ten-second countdown appeared on the screen. Darrus held on tightly and as the timer approached zero, several red lights flashed in the cockpit.

The pod came to a sudden halt and Darrus felt a pain in his thy emerge as his head was almost forced between his feet. He never was one for daily stretches. After he came to a complete stop, Darrus’ head resumed its place and the door to his left slid open. He rolled out of the pod once the handle retracted. One he stood up the pain in his cramped thy shot up his spine and he became light-headed from standing up too fast.

Shortly Darrus regained sensation to his eyes and stretched out his cramp. He remembered why he had left this city. The inside of the IOTA building was unusually clean considering the mobs of people who were making their way through the central station. The floor was white and shiny, as were the walls. It was a pleasant break from the filth he had seen since his arrival to Stellosia. The station reminded Darrus of his ship before he lost his crew and oxidation began to set in. He felt a vague sense of familiarity as he seemed to wonder around looking for an elevator. After bumping shoulders with dozens of strangers and following several signs and billboards Darrus found himself standing in front of a tall glass cylinder that extended partially from the wall, along with a mass of other people waiting for the elevator to arrive. Darrus’ destination was only one floor above the station according to a conveniently placed map of the IOTA Intersystems tower. Darrus thought he could surely walk there in less time than it would take the elevator to reach his floor but the map he was looking at showed no stairwell so he waited patiently. 

At last a cylinder arose from the floor and the elevator doors opened all at once. Darrus and the others entered the elevator and joined those who were already inside. Darrus positioned himself towards the elevator door. For an easy exit. He scanned the elevator panel and noticed that floor 657 had already been selected.

Once the doors automatically shut the cylinder rose sharply then halted abruptly. The doors reopened and Darrus plus a few others left the capsule. He noticed the dramatic change in the environment that had occurred between the station floor and this one. Fewer people were moving around. In fact, most were sitting at holographic displays, moving their hands frantically across touch pads and sensors. Again Darrus used maps to navigate his way yo the floor’s manager’s office. As Darrus approached the door, a booming voice pierced the continuous prattle and general mucus produced by the workers and their consoles. 

“I’m sorry, your highness, but you are not in a position to command me to do anything… Your reign does not reach to this planet.” There was no audible response as the voice was addressing the recipient in a call. “You will get your credits as long as there are no problems now and our next galactic upload.” Darrus proceeded to approach the door and let himself inside the office. “Yes, I assure you that IOTA is doing everything it can to give Coeille its credits. Just be patient, sir.” Darrus had opened the door carefully so not to interrupt. He began to creep inside. He was greeted by a humanoid figure standing behind a desk, its back to the door. He would have thought it waws human were it not for its slender limbs, hairless scalp, and dark blue skin. He was a Karian.

“Yes sir, I understand. Just be patient, sir. You are in good hands.” Darrus knew the figure must have been talking to a ruler of a human colony because that expression only applies in human cultures. The figure sighed upon ending the call then stood hunched over another desk and mumbled something to himself. 

Darrus made his presence known by clearing his throat. At once, the figure turned allowing the light above to shine onto his face. Darrus recognized his features as belonging to his friend Uskashed. 

“Darrus, Captain of the Axis?” Uskashed removed himself from behind his desk and embraced Darrus. “How are you? How is she? Ha Ha! How am I? Ecstatic that you are here!”

“I’m fine. The Axis, however…”

“Don’t tell me you wrecked her.”

“Nah, almost but no. She’s messed up, though. Barely made it here. I was hoping to fix her up while I was here but…”

“You don’t have enough credits.”

“Yeah.”

“Well, we’ll get to the credits later, come sit. Tell me how you managed to wreck my ship. Can I get you anything?”

“No, thanks. I don’t want to keep you from your work.”

“Nonsense! Here, sit down.”

Darrus took a seat next to a slender supporting column. He wrapped his arm around it in an effort of relaxation. 

“So,” Uskashed sighed as he sat opposite of Darrus with a steaming glass in his right hand, “Tell me what happened.”  Darrus could have easily lied but he knew his friend would understand, and besides, Uskashed has already begun to type a credit transfer on his wrist touchpad and his steaming beverage was in a cup holder built into his chair. “Well, I was cruising in this system and I received a message that the ship’s shields were spotty in certain areas.” Uskashed leaned forward, his large yellow eyes searched Darrus for a speck of falsity. “The ship was on  a steady course so I decided to go check the shield distributor underneath the hull.” He looked down again to type more of the credit transfer on his wrist pad. He only had fifteen more characters to enter before the transaction was to be completed. Darrus had just gathered his breath to speak the next portion of his story when he heard a woman scream from outside.

Uskashed stood up at once. The Karian was closer to the door so he approached it while Darrus sued the slender poll to support himself as he began to stand up to offer assistance. Uskashed opened the door and was greeted by a consequent blue flash that caused him to shield his eyes. DArrus was struck with a confusion that amplified as he felt the floor under him become bent and sturdy. He clenched tightly to the pole just in time to see Uskashed collapse from the trembling. All he heard was fading cries as the entire wall where Uskashed had fallen gave way and fell into the dark expanse along with the rest of the floor outside the manager’s office. Uskashed was starting to back up away from the ledge that just formed in front of him. Darrus was now wrapped completely around the pole. A violent wind pelted Darrus as he almost lost his grip and several large objects pelted his body. His hands and face were unprotected. Darrus was full of confusion. The only thought that occurred to him was to hold on and never let go. He tightened his grip in time to feel the floor beneath him crumble and bend toward the windy expanse. Uskashed dug his fingers into the floor which had just been waxed and slid slowly down the slope of the floor. He caught the threshold of the door and clamped it with his fingertips as his lower body was being thrashed and flung by the wind. Darrus wanted to help but if he loosened his grip at all he would be ripped from the pole and flung out of the building. A shift in the wind shook Uskashed’s grip and Darrus watched as his friend was ripped from the building and vanished into the dark clouds. Darrus showed a concerned expression as he stared into the darkness but he felt no pity or remorse. His only feelings surfaced on his face. The chilling wind numbed his bloody hands as he continued to hold the pole tighter.

The destruction seemed to slow down after that moment. The building stopped crumbling and the wind became a tolerable annoyance. Darrus remained hanging from the pole and he was beginning to realize that he needed to get down as soon as possible. His life depended on it. He was only human and the muscle that sustained his grip on the pole were becoming sore and weak. The obvious choice was to simply drop down to a lower platform and maneuver through the building to escape. He surveyed the rubble and gutted building for possible routes of desertion. He spotted another horizontal supporting structure similar to his own but about seven meters below him. It seemed his best option since below that place was an overhanging platform large enough and sturdy enough to walk on. The air around Darrus was becoming hazy due to the polluted air dissipating into the building. He resolved that action should be taken quickly before the air became too thick to see. He tried to let go but hesitated, thinking that fortune would somehow save him should he stay. He prepared again for the drop and unclenched his stiff hands. In mid-fall, he reached out his arms to grip the pole taking care not to injure himself in doing so. He impacted the pole with his chest and arms knocking out his breath. He remained hanging there for a moment to congratulate himself for his efforts and to gain the courage to make another leap onto the platform below him. It was a further drop than the last but was made easier by not having to grasp anything to save from falling. Darrus lowered himself as close to the platform as he could by hanging from the tips of his sore fingers. He let loose and fell downward slightly off the target of where he had wanted to land though still over the platform. Darrus made sure to absorb most of the impact by bending his knees upon contact and following through with a roll where space allowed.

As Darrus stood up he noticed that he could maneuver with little disturbance into an unaffected portion of the building. His underlying confusion of “What the hell just happened?” and his wanderings of Uskashed was still dwarfed by his thoughts and passions of survival. He crawled across exposed beams and moved past deformed and melted structural remains until he entered a corridor that seemed untouched except for the cracks in the flooring and other signs of destruction. As Darrus stumbled through the hallway he witnessed dozens of others in a similar state as he. Some in panic. Some in agony. And some dead. The sight of death no longer bothered Darrus, but the sight of pain, agony, and suffering continues to tear his heart. 

As Darrus made his way to the east facing side of the tower he stumbled upon a field of bodies coating the floor of a major hallway. They appeared to have been trampled to death. Darrus trudged through the marsh. Some of the bodies he stepped on still had life in them and cringed as he walked on their backs. 

Among the many twisted bodies and bruised faces that covered the floor, Darrus noticed on concealed by lavish white cloth. All that could be seen were the eyes and the immediately locked with Darrus’. He hesitated then approached the stranger and knelt beside her. He removed the cloth to reveal a blue face and welcoming eyes. It was the senator. 

“Senator?” he asked respectfully.

“Leave me! Go! The building may collapse.” Darrus knew this was true. He could feel the floor beneath him ripple on account of the wind swaying the tower.

“Are you hurt?”

“Yes, my leg… I think it's broken.” Darrus had studied the biology of her species. The Karians had a remarkable ability to recover rapidly from bone fractures, but they also have a low pain tolerance. The pain of moving alone may kill her.

Darrus took the chance and found the strength to hoist her onto his shoulder and carry her to the nearest emergency exit port. The senator was in terrible pain. The port was lined with hundreds of pads that would have each contained an escape pod. But all were gone. There was, however, a medium size freight ship preparing for takeoff. “Wait!”, Darrus yelled, “WAIT! WAIT FOR US!” He began running towards the ship. He tried to hold the senator;s broken leg still to spare her the pain. 

A figure appeared in the bay window of the ship and motioned to DArrus to hurry. Darrus continued running. The port was massive and he was almost there. A large bay door opened on the back of the ship at the same time the ship began to slowly lift off the ground. Darrus made the jump and was relieved when his feet made solid contact with the floor of the ships bay door. DArrus was greeted in the bay by a man about his age. 

“Is she hurt?”, the man asked.

“Yes, I think her leg’s broken.”

“Lay her down over here.” He began moving toward a room to the right side of the bay. Darrus eagerly followed. The bay was well lit and Darrus noticed many forms of terrestrial transportation devices and also a variety of weapons that decorated the walls. Darrus believed that the man was a rogue. On the run from someone. But Darrus didn't care. He only wanted to ensure that the senator would be alright. Darrus followed the man into the room and placed the senator on a bed.

“What can I do?”

“Bring her some water and bandages.”

The man rushed out of the room. Darrus knelt beside the bed and noticed the unusual calmness of the senator’s face. She was unconscious. Darrus heard voices echoing through the ship, there were at least four distinct voices. He caught parts of the conversation.

“We can’t take them where we are going. You know that!”

“Yes, but they must be rich, maybe they’ll compensate us for our troubles.”

“It isn’t worth them finding out.” This voice was female, sharp and demanding. “We’ll dump them on the nearest system. No exceptions.”

By now the ship had left the bay and was leaving the vicinity of the tower. There was a window above the bed and when the ship made a sharp left turn the tower was in view. There was a gaping hole in the upper portion of the tower. Much of it was burning and the top of the tower was cloaked in dense smoke. Darrus had no idea of the extent of the damage until now. He still was not certain of what the cause of the mayhem was. He began picturing the blue flash that presented the disaster. He never remembered hearing anything but that woman screaming. Maybe she saw something. 

The floor Darrus was on was the most catastrophic damage to the building but not by much. It could have been a bomb. It would make sense. The blue flash. The woman screaming. Everything but the silence made perfect sense. 

The man entered the room with bandages and water in hand. He handed them to Darrus who began wrapping g the senator’s leg. He would save the water until she was conscious. “I realize we haven’t been introduced properly as I suppose is custom.” Darrus turned to look at the man this was the first time he was able to note them man’s appearance. He was tall and thin. He was human, of course, with light skin, brown short hair, the mid-thirties. He looked tired and sickly. Darrus wasn’t prepared to give the latter so readily. “My name is Conrad McDaniels. Born on Earth raised on a ship. You probably heard the rest oof the crew a while ago.”

“Yes, I did. Who is the captain of this vessel?”

“Tell em your name first, son.”

“Darrus. I don’t know my last name.”

“You sure about that?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Okay, Darrus. Mira runs this ship. She’s got final word about everything that happens here and she says that you and your girlfriend are getting dumped as soon as we land, so don’t get comfy.”

“That’s fine, we just needed to get off that tower. Anywhere you take us, we would be grateful.” Conrad took a seat on a chair near the bed and crossed his arms while DArrus remained bedside.

“Did you lose anyone back there?”

“Yeah, a Karian. His name was Uskashed, a long time friend of mine.”

“I’m sorry for you loss.”

“It’s fine. I only needed him for his credits, and he only tolerated me because I saved his life. Did you see anything? What do you think happened at IOTA?”

“A bomb, I figure.”

“A bomb?”

“It makes sense, you know. All the Inflation with credits, people’s savings being worth less and less. Someone thought it their duty to go and blow up IOTA. Stop the creation of credits for a few days, and maybe be able to buy a meal for his family.” Darrus nodded and noticed the senator’s face scrunch.

“I think she’s waking up.” 

Conrad ignored him, “Of course everybody will see it as a political statement, whoever did it will be a galactic felon. They will search cargo ships looking for him, Shut down factory stations and the price of goods will soar. I guess Mr. Bomb Man didn’t think of that.”

“If it was a bomb, how come I didn’t hear an explosion?”

“I’ve been thinking about that as well. I figure someone made a big mistake. Did you see the flash too?”

“Blue.”

“Aye, it was not a bomb then but an ion thrust engine probably Class B. They emit blue light and put out a literally deafening white noise that drowns out all other sounds. It's made for stealth ships. It was likely on a ship in a bay somewhere rigged to blow. That would explain everything right?”

“I guess it would.”

“We’ll it don’t matter how she blew up, not to us anyways.” 

Darrus began to notice the atmosphere of the freight ship. A stark contrast from the IOTA building. It was rundown and out of date. The air was moist and mold grew on the walls and corners. 

By now, the senator had opened her eyes and was staring at Darrus.

“You…”, she said hoarsely. Darrus discarded his intrigue with Conrad and locked eyes with the pale blue woman who lay before him. “… you were on that shuttle with me.” Darrus nodded. “We were both in IOTA and you saved me.” She started to move but the forgotten pain in her leg reminded her why she needed to be saved in the first place. Conrad spoke up, “No movin’ for you, little miss. Not for a while anyway.”

“I’ll have you know that I’m a senator.”

“Well excuse me for not changing my tone when speaking to a lady of dignity. I’ll have you know that I’m the reason you didn’t burn on that godforsaken tower.” Darrus looked at Conrad in astonishment. Conrad looked at Darrus and provided his chest firmly. “I’ll just let you and Miss Prissy Puss catch up.” Darrus and the senator watched him as he stormed out of the room and headed toward the pilot’s bay.

“What’s his problem?”

“I don’t know.”, said Darrus. “We just met.”

“Well, anyways, thanks for getting me out of there although next time you could be a bit more gentle. My leg hurts like hell.”

“I’ll try.” Darrus scoffed. He knew she was joking.

“My father will likely come and take me home after we dock. Any idea where we are headed?”

“The nearest system. I heard them speaking of it. Probably Crysol-Europa.”

“Well, father will get us once we land.”

“If we land.”

“What do you mean?” She had a concerned look on her face.

“I’m not sure we con trust them. I wasn’t planning on telling them you were a senator. These people look poor and I’m not sure what they were doing at IOTA.”

“Don’t worry, Love.” a powerful female voice spoke. Darrus and the senator jerked toward the door where a purple skinned Falkmar woman stood leaning against the frame. The Flakmars were a rare species in this sector. They avoided contact with the Karians in the area who generally segregated them because of the Falkmar Rebellion that occurred hundreds of years ago. Tensions were high between the two races.

The Falkmar woman began to chuckle as she slowly entered the room. She had a scrunched face with catlike whiskers jutting from her cheekbones. Her dress was nearly non-existent, exposing as much as was socially acceptable. Thick brown fur covered her shoulders, arms, and legs her hair was shoulder-long and wavy. It concealed her ears and one eye the other was nocturnal and yellowish. Her body was curved and trim. Darrus would be lying if he said he wasn’t attracted to her. But he vowed long ago he would never mate with another species. That was before he had seen a Falkmar woman.

The Falkmar squatted by the bed and began to run her fingers through the senator’s hair in mockery. Darrus heard her whisper something in her ear but could not discern what it was. Only after that note, the senator’s eyes grew hot with fury. The Falkmar stood and turned at DArrus. She looked him over a few times, tilting her feline head. “I suppose you met Conrad. A cheeky fellow when he’s not being corrected by a spoiled aristocrat.”, she continued, “You should have seen my face when it came to my knowledge that we had a Karian on board.” Darrus began to speak but she cut him off. “Don’t worry we will drop you two off on the nearest system. If this Karian can keep her head from getting too big we will all get along peachy.” She smiled at Darrus and turned for the door. As she strode off, her fury tail brushed under Darrus’ chin. Silence remained until her footsteps were unheard outside the door.

“Some bitch!”, the senator remarked. “Even for a dirty Falkmar. She had eyes for you, though. That’s not something to be proud of.” 

“I - -”, again before Darrus could start, the only door in the small room slammed shut and locked. 
“The fact that you think I can’t hear you show plainly how foolish you are.” Mira’s voice screeched through some hidden speaker in the room. “You are not in a position to insult. You are on MY ship in MY hands. You will stay here until being dock.” There was a pause followed by minutes of steady breathing and the hum of the ship's engine.

“How’s you leg?” Darrus finally asked.

“It's healing. I can feel the muscles aligning the bone. I may faint again once the bone begins to refuse.”

“I’m glad you’re improving. Ought to be better by the time we land?”

“We’ll see.”

A bump was heard from deep within the floor followed by a jolt that rocked the room. The senator had to brace to keep from falling out of the bed. The ship’s engine whirred faster and the stars outside the bay window began to move by faster. Darrus reached inside his white captain's coat and removed an electronic tablet. After consulting the device he estimated that they would arrive on Crysol-Europa in 3-4 hours. Darrus had to censor all conversation with the senator. HE could not speak of their intentions once they landed nor anything to give them a reason not to let them go freely. Darrus put the tablet on a table by where he sat and took an inventory of the items he had to see what he may have lost during the IOTA incident. He took everything out of his pockets and carrying bags and placed it all on the table. Although he was sitting, he felt less encumbered to see the dozen or so items that lay on the table next to him. His tablet, of course, a pack of dried food, a survival knife, a universal toolkit, a broken compass passed to him from his foster parent, a small glass jar full of glowing yellow dirt, his collapsible helmet and respirator, a chain containing various metal identification plates, a digital scope, a foldable solar charger with universal plugs, and a small paper notebook and an antique ink pen for noting things he didn't want to be archived. He had only lost a hair comb and a silver coin he found yesterday on the deck of his ship. For all, he knew those items were stolen from him when he left the shuttle and was momentary blind from the smog. He would have been a prime target for any pickpocket. He took off his captain’s jacket and hung it on the backing of his chair. He glanced at the senator who lay with eyes closed. She was unconscious again. 

He picked up the tablet to search for the prices of food and lodging on Crysol-Europa to see if his credits were sufficient in case he had to stay for any length of time. He caught glimpse of the notification on the finance icon on his tablet screen. HE touched it and was greeted by a message declaring, “You received 15,000,000 Cr from Uskashed Kisol. View payment message? Yes/no” Darrus’ heart stopped. He reread the message to ensure it was correct. He assumed Uskashed was unable to send the payment. He must have finished sending the money while in freefall. Was it possible that Uskashed had somehow survived? Darrus tapped “Yes” to view the message which read. “fix ship find st” followed by an automated note reading “: message was sent automatically due to 5 minutes of inactivity. ” This suggested that USkashed was, in fact, dead and was unable to finish the message before he hit the surface of the streets below. 

Darrus did not care much for Uskashed. He was only a friend to Darrus because he was not an enemy. Uskashed kept in touch to check on the status of his ship which he gave to Darrus. He was fond of Uskashed’s heartfulness and generosity but never cared for the man himself. Financially, everything was looking up for Darrus. He had the funds to repair his ship and hire a new crew. This was made better by the fact that Uskashed was dead. He would never have to repay his debt. His future was lighting up before his eyes. First, he would repair his ship, then travel to a few systems and recruit dome ship hands. He would earn additional credits, of course, he would sell his services to anyone willing to pay. He and his crew would scavenge the galaxy searching for jobs and gaining recognition on a galactic scale. 

The racing thoughts passing through his head made the time pass by more quickly.

“How’s it look?” Darrus snapped back to reality.

“Huh?”

“How does it look?” The senator was awake on the bed and was pointing at her leg. 

“Swollen.”

“Could you take off the bandage?” Darrus stood and knelt beside the bed by her leg.

“Can you lift it?”

“Yes.”

“Hand me a pillow.” She passed him a pillow and raised her leg. Darrus placed the pillow under her thigh. He unwrapped the bandage making circular movements over and under the injured calf. As skin began to show, Darrus noticed its swollen and peculiar pulsing and purple color. 

“It's purple and beating like a heart.”

“Good. I think the structure is repaired. It's being strengthened and the tissue is reattaching to the bone.” The senator said in relief.

“Will you be able to walk soon?”

“Likely. Within an hour or so.”

“It’s amazing how fast your kind can heal.” He said as he stood and faced the door opposite the bed. “It's a shame that the Karian genome is rejected by the human chromosomes. I remember reading the histories. We have a suspicion that your kind was the key to our immortality.” Darrus looked out the small peephole in the thick metal door. “I never was one for genetic augmentation. It never turns out good for anyone. I thought it humorous that it was your kind that pushed the hardest for altering genes and causing mutation given your rich past of morals from your ancient ancestors.” Darrus paused, took in a deep breath through his nose and released from his mouth loudly. “The human soul is cursed with instability. We are never satisfied with what we have. When we see something better or someone with something better, we can’t help but want it. It's in our bones, we crave improvement but are too blind to go about getting it the right way.” A loud clank in the ship’s hull and a quick flicker of the interior lights. Darrus continued, “If we catch what we were chasing, it's never enough we’ll just chase the next think till we catch it or it kills us.” Lights in the room flashed yellow three times. “The saddest part of our condition is we never know we have a problem but nobody never tries to do anything to fix it.”

The senator sensed the tense moment and waited for Darrus to walk back to his chair, remove his coat from the chair and put it on. She watched him sling the really covering over his shoulder and worm his arms through the shiny sleeves. “We’ve entered the atmosphere.” She said.

“I know.” He began shelving his possessions back into his pockets and popped his collar. Moments passed in absolute silence. Darrus took out his tablet and poked and slid his index finger across the screen. Darrus was staring at his credit balance, saying the number in his head. “Fifteen million forty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-two.” Repair costs about two million. Freshly charged fuel cell seventy-five thousand. That left me about thirteen million to get a start on things. The senator sat up and tested the strength of her leg on the floor. 

“How is it?”

“I’ll be fine to walk if I take it easy. Back to normal soon.” 

Just then the door slid into the wall in a snap and Darrus turned to look outside. He saw the Falkmar standing with two men near the bay doors. Her thin purple arm raised toward Darrus and motioned for them to come by curing her index finger. Darrus turned his head to the senator who by now had positioned herself to see out of the door. “Come on.” He said, “I think we’re getting off.” The senator stood.

“Right you are.”, the Falkmar’s voice echoed through the bay. “Let’s go. You’ll hurry if you know what’s good for you.”, She said snarly. The senator walked to Darrus and the pair left the room and approached the Falkmar. Upon their journey the bay doors cracked and began to fold open. “Stand here please.” one of the men beside her demanded. He motioned at a red line just in front of the bay opening. “Dawn is approaching. You will need to find cover soon.” The Falkmar looked disdainfully at the senator. “It would be a shame id the Karian got toasted before her dear father could rescue her.” She checked. By now, the doors had fully opened and cool air rushed in the bay whipping the loose flaps of Darrus’ jacket. The view outside was hazy, the light was pinkish-purple and the horizon was perfectly parabolic in shape. The ship was descending and more and more of the sandy ground beneath them was visible each passing second. Darrus and the senator stood just a few feet from the edge of the bay. Just a brisk step and they would have fallen out of the ship. The ship was now only a few feet from the surface. Darrus felt a pressure impending on his rear then found himself without balance and falling out of the ship. He hit the sandy earth below with a thud and looked to his left where the senator lay as hi, on her face in the sand. The roar of the ship’s engines was deafening. Darrus turned while laying on his front and looked at the bay opening of the ship. The Falkmar bent over the ledge, blew the pair a kiss, smiled and waved her hand as the ship elevated and accelerated out of view.

Darrus stood without trouble and assisted the senator to her feet. “You ok?”

“Yes, my leg is fine. It still hurts but I’ll be fine.”

The atmosphere was hazy and it burned the throat to breathe.“We need to find shelter. Look for something sticking out of the sand. The sun is hot as Hell. It’ll fry us if we stay outside. ” Darrus looked east. “We’ve got maybe ten minutes till she starts rising. Let’s go toward those dunes.” He pointed west where a group of hills lay gleaming in the pink haze. The two began moving to the dunes as quick as they were able. The loose sand slipped under their feet making it difficult to make any noticeable speed. They reached the base of a small dune and climbed it, flinging scoops of sand and dust behind them. Once on top of the dune, Darrus looked over his shoulder and was greeted by a glistening ruby crescent inching above the horizon. Even though the dense haze, it was already bright enough to burn his eyes. He looked all around, pale tired eyes squinting. His hand on his brow to shield the rising sun. Through the dust, he saw a dark cylinder jutting from the stand a good distance away. He pointed, “There! Hurry the sun is rising faster now.” He led the way sliding down the sandy slope as the senator followed. At the bottom of the slope, Darrus stumbled but was able to regain his posture with the weight if his arms. The senator began to stumble likewise but he braced her and the two began trecking through the sand.

DArrus could feel the sand filling in his boots but it didn't matter now. All that mattered was speed. The cylinder they were chasing may be blocked off. Then what? He would have to find another one or be burned alive. There was no shade, no trees just sand and the dunes would do little to block the sun. IT was higher now Darrus felt the heat on his back. His eyes were fixed on the cylinder when he stumbled in the cumbersome sand. Only then did he lose sight for a second. 

The stand in for of him grew redder and his shadow became more distinct from the lighted sand around it. Darrus knew the sun was rising fast. He felt the heat on his neck increase by degree. He dared not look at it, his eyes on the cylinder. “What if this one’s blocked?”, He thought. The senator kept pace with Darrus, they were both panting heavily and almost out of breath but the intense heat of the red sun pushed them on. Darrus began to see details about the cylinder. Engraved on the side going along the length of the tube were letters reading “ENTE” the rest was covered with sand. The last letter almost indecisive, it could easily be a “B” if out of context. The cylinder was indeed a pipe protruding from the sand at an angle with a metal staircase leading to the opening. They had reached the pipe and turned to climb the stairs. DArrus felt the burning sun on the right side of his face. It singed his whiskers as he cranked open the vault door in front of the large metal pipe. 

The sun was blaring. It appeared as a wave of molten rock over the horizon. The senator shielded her face with her flowing garments. Darrus pulled the door outward. He pulled the senator inside with him just as he thought he heard his face begin to sizzle. 

Inside the tube, there were stairs going downward but no railing. Old irrelevant lights hung strung on a wire over their heads and followed the downward path of the stairs clinging to the ceiling. Darrus looked at the senator whose burns were already beginning to heal. Darrus’ face was red on its right side and his right eyebrow was signed. Darrus was breathing rapidly, as was the senator. Their breathing slowed to an almost normal pace. “What is this?”, the senator asked breathlessly. 

“It's an entrance to on of the underground cities of Crysol-Europa. I suppose we’ll go in and try to contract your father. We certainly can’t go back outside until night.” They began their descent down the sand coated steps. The dim glow of the lights did little in the way of illumination. The details of the stairwell were limited to sight although, the open door behind them allowed in more light than the bulbs could put out. The circular walls were coated with gritty and a thin layer of dust on top. A few steps were loose and three were missing from the case. He caught the absence of a step early and made an unnatural brisk step at the gap to compensate. The air cooled as they went deeper and moisture adhered to the slick metal steps making them slippery. An entrance was visible as the slope of the cylinder flattened into a straight walk. Here an uneven mixture of sand and brown water settled in a puddle. 

Darrus estimated they were at least 100 feet under the surface. A large amount of chatter could be heard through the tubular echo that reverberated in the steel tube. They approached an archway at the end of the tunnel where a wooden sign hanging lopsided by one rusty chain read, “South Markets”. The sound of a busy, bustling street filled the atmosphere as Darrus walked through the arch and caught his first glimpse of the city. The path in front of him was straight. On either side strips of booths, stands, tables and shelves stood adjacent. Each station packed with produce, trinkets, and scrap. Shopkeepers yelled and harassed passers-by. Those in the street wheeled carts, carried buckets and bags. Space was cramped and support beams made of flagpoles, streetlamps, and stacked bricks stood staggered in the path. All the people were dirty. All the air was smelly. This was Slum Hole City.

“You better take my hand,” Darrus shouted over the ruckus of the bustling marketplace. The senator stretch her soft blue hand and arm covered in lavish white cloth. Darrus clasped it and began to lead through the strip. Almost immediately the merchants took notice of their obvious wealth. Darrus pulled the senator closer as some merchants left their stands and ran toward them. 

“Fresh food for starved travelers!”

“Fuel cells, bolts, and tools. Cheap!”

“Nothing like a gulp of water Fresh from the spring.”

“Food capsules! Energy vitamins, minerals proteins all in one tiny pill”

Their slogans formed into begs and pleas as the shopkeepers smuggled Darrus and the senator.

“C’mon only 500 credits.”

“You buy this! You need it!”

“Everything, buy it!”

“This is cheap! You pay! You pay, now?”

Darrus held the senator close and kept advancing not sure if he was still walking straight. He felt something odd in his jacket and looked down to see an arm reaching into his coat pockets. He grabbed the arm firmly and tore it out of his jacket then yanked it in to reveal a human face. An old wrinkled male with a deep scar across his face looked fearfully at his face and opened his mouth revealing several missing and rotten teeth. Darrus released the frail arm and the thief wondered off. Darrus reached the end of the market strip as the sellers, one by one left to return to their stands, defeated in their attempts, looking for new prey. 

As the blinding wall of vendors diminished. Darrus found himself in a new area in more neglect than the market. Firelight originated from metal drums and flickered about the rims of the barrels. The light danced across the walls and floor revealing a march of sand and mud on the ground and bare rock walls braced with wood. Beings sat against the walls each barely clothed and covered with mud. The thick red clay and sand stuck to the treads of their shoes as they continued into the tunnel. Darrus looked over his shoulder at the bustling market.

“So where are we going?”, the senator asked.

“Not sure. We find a decent place and try to contact your father.” She nodded.

The dilapidated and underkept tunnels were a stark contrast from the lively marketplace. Filth and garbage coated the floor. The air in the dim tunnels was humid and smelled of sickness and urine. Ahead was a large intersection. This area was hollowed out more into the ground and had higher walls. This section was more civilized that the others Partially clothed beings scurried from door to door. Some sat on buckets and benches made of mounds of dirt. Tubes punctured the ceiling provided diluted sunlight from the surface illuminating the station magnificently. A marvelous machine was planted in the middle of the plaza. A giant rusted, decaying machine with moving pistons, draping tubes stretching out to the walls. The machine cranked and steamed, it sucked in air and blew it out through vents riveted all over the structure. If the shanty city a living being, this machine would be a tumorous lung.

Darrus led the senator through the diseased crowd in the station and settled in front of one of the blowing vents to take a few fresh breaths. 

“Try to contact your father,” Darrus spoke loudly over the clanking machine and the rustling crowd. The senator reached into her garments and removed a small metallic rod held the road with her thumb. A blue hard light screen materialized just beyond her clenched knuckles. Using her free hand she made a dew meticulous swiped and pokes across the cool frictionless plane. She looked concerned and raised the device above her head, watching the screen. She lowered her arm and looked at Darrus. “No connectivity,” she said in defeat. Darrus looked surprised, “I guess we are too far under the surface.”

“So how will we contact your Father?”

“We will have to wait until night then go to the surface.” The senator looked worried.

“I don’t want to stay here long. Use your tablet see if you have a connection.”

Darrus removed his tablet and checked. “Nothing.” He looked around the station and spotted a clock under a vent on the far wall. The clock was labeled into safe and danger zones corresponding to times of the day. The hand had just entered the “Danger zone” and “Safe zone” was thirty-four hours away. 

“Looks like we’ll be stuck here for a while.” He said, at last.

“No, No, No.” she held her hands tight over her face and cringed. “No! I can’t stay here. It's disgusting and dirty. No not even for another hour. I must leave!”

“Why? It's not that bad.” An unfamiliar voice passed through the vent behind them. Darrus and the senator turned to the location of his voice. A large rectangular vent with a rusty grill screwed in place. The event belonged to the mechanization in the center of the station. 

“I’m sorry to- Ow!” A metallic thud was heard. 

“Stupid. Friggen. Met- uh. I’m sorry to intrude but I think I can help you people.”

A figure could be seen approaching through the mesh of the vent cover as it entered the gridded light.

“Who are you?” Darrus asked as the figure began unscrewing the bent cover from the inside. 

“Oh, I’m a nobody. I fix things when they break. Been unclogging this thing. Somebody thought it was a good idea to piss in one of the vents. Screws rusted shut. Can’t turn it. Stand back!”

He kicked the vent and it popped out of the hole and tumbled on the dirt floor. The being in the vent crawled out and stood before the two. He was human, white with dirt, mud, filth, and oil on his clothes and skin. He wore baggy torn pants and an old dirty t-shirt with a faded print design. He had blonde hair, medium length, wild and matted with dirt and oil. He was young and slim. His right hand rested on his tool belt as he looked at Darrus and the senator. 

“So you can help me call my father?”

“Maybe, there’s a lightning rod attached to this machine. I just cleaned it. I can wire your tablet to it and amplify your signal. Hand it here.”

Darrus gave him the tablet. “You don’t mind if I crack it open, I’ll put it back later.”

“No, go ahead.”, Darrus answered.

“Name’s Sam, by the way.” Sam cracked open the case of the tablet and opened a panel on the machine. 

“Nice to meet you, Sam. You seem kind of young to be working out here.” Sam took some wired from his tool belt and attached them to the gutted tablet. 

“We’ll I’m seventeen and I don’t work for nobody. I jus’ fix things in the city, if I don’t do it it just stays broke and that’s no good.” Sam attached the other end of the wires to the exposed rod. “I only stay here cause I have to. I got no money, can't leave the planet or the city. Here make your call.” He passed the tablet to the senator. 

“Got signal! He did it.”

“Yep.”, said, Sam. “Looks like these poles can do more than attract lightning and static discharge.”

“Thanks”, Darrus said, “We owe you one.”

“Nah ya don’t. Wasn’t nothin’ but two pieces of wire and I can get them back when you’re done.”

“You didn;t have to help us.”

“Yeah, but I wanted to.”

“You any good with ships?”

“I fixed a Karian patrol cruiser just yesterday. Had a busted pulse accelerator. I specialize in Karian tech and most human ships. What you got?”

“Got a Class C Karian cruiser with some human components. Carbon tube and some old steel. Ran her through an asteroid field. It's got a few holes and dents few parts are busted.”

“I might do something with that.”

“If you come with me and fix up my ship, I’ll get you off this planet and drop you anywhere in this system you want.” The senator was speaking silently into the tablet.

“Hell yeah! I’ll go with you. Screw this city. It can rot without me. It WILL rot without me!” A sudden light appeared in his eyes. “You seem like nice rich folks. I’ll go. sure.” Darrus looked at the senator and back at Sam.

“Her father will come and take us off the planet.”

“Karian royalty? Can’t go wrong there. Royalty gonna escort me off this planet!”

“That’s the plan. I hope you're not so giddy once we get grounded.”

“Yes, sir. I’m just excited that’s all.”

Darrus smiled. He wasn't sure about this mechanic. But he was willing to take a chance to save some credits. 

An unusual tone of mucus began to emit from the dirt tunnel that darrus passes through to get to the station. Panicked and fearful screams. Darrus looked into the tunnel and saw the hurting shadows flicker on the dirt all the senator heard the commotion and ended her call abruptly. The sounds odd pain and resistance echoed from the tunnel and soon papers by began to draw near. A clump of beings exited the tunnel in a wild frenzy and scattered into the station in a hurried panic. In pursuit, a large creature entered the station from the same opening. A four - legged, called creature with forward but muscular legs covered in dirty white scales. An elongated lizard body and short stubby tail attached to a ferocious and wild toothy head. The monster;s meaning eyes peered through tiny slits monsters menacing eyes peered through tiny slits in its upper head. The creature paused as drops of red blood dripped from its mouth Ti twisted its neck to survey the new environment Darrus grabbed the senator’s arm and situated himself between her and the beast. Sam stood in fear as the beast stopped it turning head to his. Darrus instinctively reached for his gun in his empty holster on his leg. Panic began to set in as his eyes locked with the beast. His back against the breathing machine, his cold fingers feeling the vacant rim of his holster. The beast bent its legs and lowered its body in a pouncing position. Darrus took a loud breath through his nose and swallowed his courage. 

Darrus knew running would instigate chase. The frozen senator and Sam knew this also. The beast straightened its back legs in an instant, providing a forward lift to its body. Three thunderous pulses echoed in the station, walking Darrus from his fear. Darrus’ senses keened and he saw a man with a rifle in hand, aimed at the beast who faltered in its leap and its called body limped in flight and crashed and slid at Darrus’ feet. DArrus looked down at the magnificent beast using deep purple fluid from its head. The royal blood flowed down the beast’s face, following in the grooves between its thick white scales. Then Sam spoke up, “Hell yeah! Killed that bitch dead!” HE shoved Darrus’ arm playfully. “Did you see that? Sucker had eyes on you, you was a dead man. Then ‘POW’ killed him. ” Darrus looked for the man with the rifle but he had vanished Sam continued ranting over the victory as those who had taken refuge began to emerge and surround the beast. Indistinct chatter persisted as Darrus calmed his nerves and resumed normal function. One voice shouted, “Where did this thing come from?” Another voice spoke up.

“Came from outside, it’s scales is still hot.” Darrus sensed trouble and signaled his leave to the senator and Sam who was kicking the beast repeatedly in triumph. The three left the mass of the crowd as another man demanded, “Who left the damn door open?” Darrus hurried his step once he heard this, Sam and the senator kept pace. 

“It was them rich folk! I saw em’ dat one with the shiny coat.” A man stretched and pointed over the heads of the crowd at DArrus. The heads of the mass turned together to the fleeing trio. “Flog em’ men! Take em’ for what der’ worth!” Darrus ran around the massive machine and approached the entrance of another tunnel, one plated with flattened metal scraps and angled up the hill. The crowd was in senseless pursuit with them soon after. Darrus looked for any chance of escape or cover as he ran over the clanking metal floor. Amidst the roaring chase, nobody heard the small metalling pings of a small canister bounce across the ground nearby. A blinding white flash accompanied by a trembling wave of successive pulses that slowed in a repetitive order. Darrus and all the others saw nothing but white; They had no consciousness or feeling or awareness. To Darrus and the rest, there was only white. 

Four KArians armored with thick metallic white suits that reflected a pale blue when the light hit them at a certain angle approached the frozen crowd. They weaved between statue like figures, frozen in their chase with legs bent, some on one foot. They casually, peeking at each face of the frozen figures. Ahead of the multitude, three figures grouped in fleeing pose. The men gathered around the group. One looked deeply into the frantic eyes of the senator. HE noted the look of fear on her blue face. “Found her.” The other men confirmed the claim. “Tag her. I’ll catch her.” He moved in front of the senator. Another place a device on the senators head and delivered a small shock. Instantly she came back to life running as she had been. She felt the sudden embrace of a stranger and screamed in fear. “Karian Police, remain calm!” The man restrained the struggling woman. “Look! Look at me!”, he said, “We were sent by your father. We are rescuing you. ” The senator looked at the other officers and the frozen others. As she started to relax, the officer released his hold. “Come, there is a royal ship outside.” The officer began to lead the senator away. 

“Wait!”, she escaped the leading arm, “These two are with me.” She scurried to Darrus and Sam.

“These here?”

“Yes.”

“Lado, Spezoli, catch these men, I’ll tag them.” The officers took their position and the one with the device delivered the shock to Sam then Darrus. They each ran forward into the clutch of the officers who restrained them until they calmed. Sam, especially, put up a struggle. “Karian Police, calm down. You - ” Sam shocked the officer in the face. Another officer held Sam’s kicking legs. “Sam! Sam! Snap out of it! You’re safe. ” Sam relaxed and met eyes with DArrus.

“They temp froze us,” Darrus said.

“Well, I didn’t ask for it.”

“Well, they did save us.”

Darrus moved so Sam could see the frozen mob. “Alright, lemme down.” He said reluctantly. The officers set him on his feet and Sam jerked away in disgust. The officers grouped the three and escorted them back through the still rioters. Altogether, the reflective places on each of their helmets lifted and scrolled in all directions into the frames revealing stern dark blue faces. The officer in front, wielding his pearly weapon at his shoulder pointed downward spoke, “We have come on behalf of Karian High Councilman MAsito.” He noticed the others staring at the posed figures with forwarding set eyes and bent limbs, “Don’t worry, they’ll thaw soon.”, The officer said reassuringly. Darrus and the senator became aware that their actions were being noticed and straightened their gaze while Sam stepped out of formation and approached one of the figures and topped it with a push. The others watched as they walked. “He stole my lunch last week.”, Sam said in defense as he moved back into form. 

“Where is my father?”, the senator asked the guard leading the group.

“Councilman Masito is in an emergency conference concerning the IOTA bombing. He will meet with you shortly on board the royal cruiser.” The group rounded the steaming air machine and passed the fallen beast. A poor and starving man were squatted beside, carving the beast for meat. They entered the fire lit tunnel to the markets. The mud and slush squished under their feet. The market was devastated. Fruits and packaged goods were toppled from their stands and lay scattered and bruised on the floor. Merchants were showing looters as well as erecting their fallen stands and containers. They crossed the market with little trouble and passed through the archway and into the tunnel. They traveled up the slippery steps and gathered near the recently closed vault door. The vault radiated head from outside as did the inner walls of the cylinder. The officer reached a gloved hand into a rigid container attached to his upper leg. He pulled out a bundle of thin, highly reflective sheets that fit into his clenched hand. He passed the sheets to Sam, the senator, and DArrus, whose face was still red on the right side. “Cover yourselves with these. They will protect you from the light. Wrap it over your face. You can see through it from the inside.” The three did as hey were told. Darrus was amazed at the thinness and strength of the sheets as well as the mysterious properties he discovered once wrapped in them. He felt a sudden cooling of his body and the air he breathed seemed cleaner and cool. “The ship is just outside. Go down the stairs quickly, but watch your step. We’ve sprayed the steps with Insul-gel so they shouldn't be too hot. ” The guard opened the vault wide. The others passed through. The last guard shut the vault tight.

Outside, gusts of air pounded the stair frame and shook the structure. The sun now was in full effect. Casting its rays upon the surface to scorch everything in its light. Darrus followed Sam down the stairs who followed the senator being held by two officers and rushed to safety. The cloaks offered complete protection to Darrus and the others. They even darkened their view to preventing damage to their sight. The officers’ armor protected their bodies from the red rays and their helmets with face shields up did similarly. The group filed into the small patrol ship unscathed. The officers took their seats up front. The others sat together in the back. The pilot started the engines and the ship rose, turned sideways and began to accelerate and elevate into the red sky. Darrus and the senator unwrapped their cloaks and returned them up the front to the officer. Sam stuffed him in his pocket. The others didn’t notice. Darrus spoke up, “So where are we going?”

“Royal Cruiser. It’s in orbit here. We’ll meet with councilman MAsito there. I suppose you will want us to take you someplace.”

“Yes, my cruiser is in orbit of Armes, right above Stellosia.”

“Stellosia? Didn’t happen to see the IOTA building did you?”

“Sure did. I was just there. Pulled the senator out of the tower, she was hurt. She’s fine now.”

“Senator Masito, what were you doing at IOTA?”

“Business.”, she said quickly.

“You had nothing scheduled for today.”

“Unexpected meeting.”

“I see.” The officer looked out the window to his right at the sandy red planet shrinking as the ship left the atmosphere. “How did you end up here?” He asked.

“Well,” said Darrus, “We took a ride off of IOTA and they dropped us there on Crysol-Europa”

“They must have hated you guys”, the officer chuckled.

“There was a Falkmar on board.”

“Dirty creatures. And heartless to leave you stranded there.” The ship turned to bring a large metallic white clump, gleaming in the intense light of the nearby sun. 

“Is that the royal ship?”, Darrus asked.

“Yes, The Courier 12 royal ship and home of the Masito family and royal guard.” Darrus thought for a moment and turned to the senator. “You know, you haven’t told me your name yet.”

“Things have been happening so fast since we met. I don’t think I heard your name either.”

“Well, I’m captain Darrus.” He reached out his hand. 

“Senator Siahya Masito.” She shook it.

“Samuel Shays, former matinee engineer of Shit Hole City.” The others looked at Sam who casually started forward and took no notice of the others attention. The Courier 12 was enormous compared to the small cruiser approaching it. Nothing about the ship was straight. It was composed of what seemed as a compilation of series and tubes tangled and interwoven into a massive ball of shimmering white metal. The ship served only three purposes. To protect, house, and transport the royal family. Beauty was not part of its function. The small cruiser raced alongside the ship and attached itself to a mechanical clamp that rotated and brought the ship through an airlock and into a hanger stocked with similar cruisers. The hanger was spotless and white glowing blue markings on the floor and walls. The mechanical claw moved the cruiser over the floor stocked with hundreds of cruisers prepped for battle all lined up in rows. The Arm lowered the ship into a gap in the sequence and released its grip to fold upwards into the ceiling and moved to another task. The group exited the cruiser and the officers led them past rows of metallic ships, past several guarded entrances into a large room with a long rectangular table surrounded by dozens of white chairs. “You two take a seat. Counselor Masito wishes to see his daughter. I assume you want to be returned to your ship.”

Darrus spoke up, “Yes. I would appreciate it.”

“It shouldn't be a problem with Chancellor Masito considering you saved his daughter. I’ll notify the pilot. Over Stellosia you say?”

“Yep.”

“Alright.” The officer sent coordinates to the pilot using the computer on his gauntlet. “Senator Masito, if you would come with us. We’ll be back soon.” Darrus and Sam took seats opposite each other as the guards left with the senator. Darrus waited until the sound of footsteps faded and only the hum beneath the floor and liquids flowing in insulated pipes were heard. Darrus looked intently at Sam. He noticed his boyish face and slumped posture. “I saw the cooling cloak sticking out of your pocket.”, Sam didn’t answer. “You didn’t return yours?” 

Sam spoke, “He didn’t ask me to return it. And he didn’t care that I kept it.”

“Nobody said you could keep it, though.”

“So?”

“So that’s stealing.”

“No it's not! The guy gave it to me to use and I may still need it.”

“Those must be expensive It’s unlikely he would just give it to you.”

“Well, he did and it's mine!”

“Ok, It's fine. I’m just saying if you’re gonna work for me now you can’t be stealing from me. I know it may seem like you aren't doing anything wrong, but I won’t tolerate it. I’ve got no problem with putting you right back on Crysol-Europa. We have a deal. You fix my ship. And I get you off that planet.”

Sam waved Darrus off with his hand, “Yeah sure. Whatever.”

“I hope you’re not more trouble than you’re worth, Sam. All I’m saying is I won’t put up with you if I catch you doing anything that hurts me. You won't have to steal while you’re with me. I’ll keep you fed and provide you with everything you need.”

“Ok, I’ll be good.”, Sam said snarly. 

There was an awkward pause.

“You must not be as rich as I thought,” Sam said, “If you need someone like me to do your work.” Darrus thought for a moment. He recalled the fifteen million credits in his name but said nothing of it. Instead, Darrus replied, “You just happened to be where I was and we have mutual goals.”

“Yeah sure, I’ve lain to my entire life. ‘Yeah this water’s good to drink, Sam.’, ‘Don’t look at me Sam, I didn’t bust the humidifier.’, ‘You’re doing fine out there Sam, the sun doesn't come up for another three hours.’ Don’t think I can’t tell when somebody’s holding back on me. I wanna know why you were on Crysol-Europa. I wanna know why you need me. And I wanna know what the hell you're holding from me. After you tell me, Then I’ll let you bash me for ‘stealing’”. Sam was becoming impatient and furious. 

“Ok Sam, I’ll tell you.” Darrus took a moment to recollect past events. “I was visiting a friend at work in the IOTA Tower. The tower was attacked and I rescued the Senator. We caught a ride off the tower. The company wasn’t too nice to us and they left us for dead on Crysol-Europa. We made it to the city before we got fried. And that's where we met you. AS I’ve said many times, I need you to fix my ship, The Axis. THat’s the reason I decided to take you. That, and you didn’t seem like you’d be much trouble at the time. I’m going, to be honest and say ‘yes, I’m hiding something from you.’” Darrus rubbed is hand and felt the hard lump where his PCI was embedded. “I’m not going to tell you, though. You’ll have to trust me when I say it does not concern you. Is that good enough for now?” 

Sam bit his lip and brushed the dirty hair away from his eyes. He looked amused at Darrus’ concerned expression. His eyes darted all over Darrus’ face and body. Sam chuckled quietly. “Fair enough.”, he said. 

“Good. Let’s try to be friends until you’re done with my ship.”

“Oh, I’ll fix your ship. Patch up the holes, replace junked systems. Damn, I bet that fusion regulator is prepared. But Darrus, If you want us to be friends you’ll have to pay me with those credits your hiding.”

Darrus kept a steady expression. He showed no obvious sign of astonishment, but he felt it. He looked Sam over and saw that he was firm in his statement. Finally, he asked, “How did you know?”

Sam smiled. Seeing how he had turned the conversation around. “You see, Darrus, I’m a good mechanic because broken machines are deceivers, just like you Darrus. Somebody brings me a  ship and says she won’t go past quarter light speed anymore. Says she starts knocking and the ion dissimulator charge won’t hold. Any learned mechanic will say ‘well there's a circuit someplace getting shorted. ’ and he’ll spend weeks trying to find it. Whereas me, I’ll take a look around, see what she does when she’s running. I won’t even have to fly hero nothing and I’ll see it wasn't no short. There's something lodged in the charge coils. A ship will lie to you like that, so will people. But I can figure em’ out.”

“So what? You’re like a human lie detector?”, Darrus asked.

“Yes, but its more than just that. I can see what makes people tick. What’s important to them what they want. And when what they say doesn't match how they fell, then I know they are lying. ”

Darrus was in disbelief, “Why then did you ask me to explain myself earlier If you already knew?”

“I didn’t know, Darrus.”, he said calmly, “Every machine is different. Those questions were calibrations. How many credits do you have, by the way? Got to be more than 10 million. What is it? 12? No, 16? Too much? Oh, 15? Is that it?”

Darrus showed no expression. “Fifteen? Yes!”, Sam asked.

“So why are you like this?”, Darrus asked.

“So it is fifteen. Fifteen million credits.”, he said slowly.  “That’s a nice retirement package.”

“Well, I’m not ready to settle down.”

“What is it you do exactly?” Darrus remembered asking himself the same question on the shuttle to Stellosia. The question caused emotions within him to reveal themselves. Darrus still didn’t know the answer. He knew not to lie to Sam. He should tell him something that would interest him. He recalled Sam’s character and what bits he has gleaned from their talk. 

“Mercenary.” Sam looked him over but detected nothing. 

“I see.”, Sam replied. “You work alone?”, Darrus felt sick at the thought, “I do now. Lost my crew last week.”

“What happened?”, Sam asked as if he didn’t already know. He watched Darrus. Shame Sadness. Regret. Anger. Lust. Darrus debated telling Sam but reasoned he would pry it out of him either way. “We fell apart.”, Darrus struggled to keep emotions covered. “There was ten of us. Good crew, we had our differences and disputes but we respected each other. Times got tough for us. Started to get low on credits, tempers ran high. They were all in it for the credits and loot. They honestly didn’t care for me as a captain. When they stopped getting their sums they quit. I just picked em up after I got the ship. To them, it was only a job nothing more. We needed a team. With more to hold us together than money.”

“So that's what you want out of life?” Sam asked, “A family or some shit? A happy family of mercs? I got news for you pal, I’m only doing this cause it gets me off that godforsaken rock. I’m tired of being nice, there was no ‘family’ back there. There was blood and hate and sickness and money, that what I’m used to and you better get used to it too because whether you’re on that rock or another, that’s all there is”

“You’re right.”, Darrus said. “I can’t find a family out here. I just hope that my next crew will be a bit more loyal, that’s all.”

“I’m not part of your crew, Darrus. But I’ve agreed to fix your ship and I won’t leave before it's done.”

“Thank you, Sam, that’s all I’m asking. I must warn you though she’s pretty wrecked. Most of the work is just hull repair. I can do most of that myself. It's the more technical parts I need you for. ”

“I can do it.”, he replied confidently, “Doesn't matter I can fix it. I’ll try to save you credits where I can. I suppose you’ll be buying all the parts I need.”

“Yes, just look over the ship when we get there make a list of what you need.”

A foreign light shown from the hall as the door at the front of the room slid open revealing the senator, Siahya dressed in new clothes and skin, a clean fair blue.

“We are approaching The Axis’ airspace, Darrus. My fa-”

“Her father would like to thank you, captain.” It was an intriguing and hearty voice. A shadow accompanied Siahya’s on the floor in the conference room. A Karian stood tall next to her at the doorway dressed even more extravagantly than the senator. Darrus stood in respect. His features were tired and wrinkled but he had a pleasant look about him. He appeared as a wise old stage dressed in pearly white robes with aquatic accents that complemented his faded blue skin. He had a thinly trimmed mustache and a small pointed beard.

“I cannot express my gratitude, captain. Siahya has enlightened me as to the events of recent hours.”, he said as he walked toward Darrus and took his hands and held them. Darrus watched his six long blue fingers clasp around him with such sincerity and gentleness. He looked up and into the console's pale eyes. “She has told me that you saved her from The IOTA and led her back to me. Is this true?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then it is my honor to bestow upon you the greatest gift I can supply to you.”

“Sir?”

“I’m sure you are aware, with all your wisdom of Karian tradition.” Darrus knew very well but remained silent for he had not thought of the repercussions of rescuing a Karian senator until this moment, and the thought intrigued him.
